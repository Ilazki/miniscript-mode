A half-assed, hacked together major mode for the Lua-like embedded scripting language, [MiniScript](https://miniscript.org/).

There are two slightly different versions of it.  miniscript-mode.el only provides highlighting for normal MiniScript features, while greyscript-mode.el has additional highlighting for functions provided by the [Grey Hack](https://greyhackgame.com/) game's API.

No indentation rules yet.  Possibly not ever.
